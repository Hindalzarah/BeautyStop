# Final Project - TUWAIQ ACADEMY


#### **THIS REPOSITORY WILL CONTAIN AN ANDROID TO DO LIST APP**

<hr>

## topics we're going to talk about in this readme file:

<hr>

* List of technologies I  used to develop this app.
* Link to my wireframe in this case I used Figma.
* My user stories.
* Story about my development process and problem-solving strategy.
* List of unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
* Describtion of how some of my favorite functions work.


### TECHNOLOGIES:

<hr>

* I used figma to help me do a scetch of how I want my app to look like.
* I used android studio and took my figma scetch and transformed it into a deisgn using the android studio xml layout.

### My Development Process:
 
 * Planning: First, I started to plan how I want my application to look like, and how it's going to function, what features I want to include in it.
 * Requirement specification: Second, I went ahead and documented the requirements and specifications that were asked from me to develop the app.
 * Design: Third, I begin to design the app using figma, I picked the primary and secondary colors for my app, started to design my buttons and layout.
 * Coding: Forth, I started to work on my code and the logic behind it and wrote the functions I needed for my app to work.
 * Testing: Fifth, Finally, I started  testing my app using the debugging tools in the android studio.
